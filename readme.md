# Course notes for STAT7679
This Repo contains course notes and other useful learning materials

## Getting Started
This is the first github Repo in my life. The notes will be sorted by different topics. If you (I'm talking to myself) don't know, or forget how to work with git, check the git-notes.md.<br/> 
Hint: check preview for markdowm formate before pushing it to github!<br/> 
Those stupid and embarrassing resords are in the history and I don't know how to remove it!<br/>
